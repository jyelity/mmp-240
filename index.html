    <p>I am an aspiring Advertising & Marketing Communications major and full-time student at Johnson & Wales University. Always looking for opportunities to set new trends, teach and be teachable, and meet new people. I thrive in environments where I can apply my passion for advertising & marketing communications and social media that are innovative. It doesn't feel like work because I genuinely love what I do.</body>
